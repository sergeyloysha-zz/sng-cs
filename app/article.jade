            p That was the message from current and former public- and private-sector cybersecurity professionals Friday a panel at an International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium event in Washington D.C.
            p The four panelists all agreed that it’s time to lean on people sharing, disseminating and understanding threat information in order to move from being reactionary to every cyber incident.
            p Inglis framed collaboration as the human equivalent of integrating various security technology together, with the two ideas forming a more holistic view of how malicious actors are behaving in cyberspace.
            p “We need to stop shooting bullets with bullets and turn this from a transaction approach where we are going at this tactic by tactic or event by event, and turn it to where we are understanding the connection all of those transactions to a behavior and we can look at this from the standpoint of ‘can we actually determine that this behavior against this thing of value?” Inglis said.

            p The government, particularly the Department of Homeland Security has spent the past year standing up their Automated Indicator Sharing system for precisely this purpose — to bridge the gap between the public and private sector in order to better communicate on what security professionals are dealing with in a real-time basis. While the panelists generally viewed the department’s efforts as positive, more needs to be done to get companies to truly the threats to their systems.
            p Leo Scanlon, Acting Chief Information Security Officer at Department of Health and Human Services said a lot of the people who could benefit from the information flowing through AIS still need to be taught how to pull meaning out of the threat indicators.      
            p “The first problem you run into is that not everybody can consume this stuff,” Scanlon said. “There is a whole long chain of folks that just can’t consume this information without a different type of analytical process topped onto it. It takes an analytical path to communicate across entities, especially entities that don’t have electronic integration at a sophisticated level.”
            p The fanciest cybersecurity tools in the world are not going to help America keep up with the advanced hacking threats the nation faces unless more emphasis is placed on collaboration between the people using the technology.
            p Scanlon praised the ISAC model as a way for more companies to be collaborative in how they defend against threats.
